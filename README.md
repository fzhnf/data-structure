# Data Structure in C

## About

This repo is just for me learning data structures and algorithms in C.

## Usage

I assume you are using Linux or WSL.

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/rvyhvn/data-structure`
1. After the repo has clone into your machine, go to the directory `cd data-structure`
1. Compile the files into binary using Makefile by executing `make`

-   Run the sorting algorithms by using `./main sort <sorting_algorithm>`
    Available sorting algorithms: bubble, heap, insertion, selection, merge, quick
-   Run the data structures by using `./main <command> [options]`
    Available data structures (command): stack, bag, queue

Note: the program will tell you what to do with the commands.

Example for data structure:
`./main stack push stack.csv 1`

Example for sorting algorithm:
`./main sort bubble`
